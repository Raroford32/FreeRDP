## ‚öôÔ∏è Performance Tuning

### Thread Count Optimization

- **Low-end systems**: 10-20 threads
- **Mid-range systems**: 20-50 threads  
- **High-end systems**: 50-100 threads
- **Network bottleneck**: Start with 20, increase if network can handle it

### Network Considerations

- **Local network**: Higher thread counts work well
- **Internet targets**: Lower thread counts to avoid detection/blocking
- **Rate limiting**: Monitor target responses for rate limiting

### Memory Usage

- **Large wordlists**: Monitor system memory usage
- **Max limits**: 100K IPs, 10K users, 100K passwords per run
- **Split large jobs**: Use multiple smaller runs for very large datasets

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Build Issues

```bash
# Missing FreeRDP headers
sudo apt-get install libfreerdp-dev libwinpr-dev

# Build FreeRDP from source if system version incompatible
./build.sh local

# Check dependencies
pkg-config --exists freerdp3 && echo "FreeRDP 3.x found"
pkg-config --exists freerdp2 && echo "FreeRDP 2.x found"
```

### Runtime Issues

```bash
# Permission denied
chmod +x rdp-brute

# Missing libraries
ldd rdp-brute  # Check library dependencies

# Segmentation fault
# Usually indicates missing or incompatible FreeRDP libraries
# Try rebuilding with ./build.sh local
```

### Performance Issues

- **Low connection rate**: Increase thread count with `-t`
- **High CPU usage**: Decrease thread count  
- **Memory issues**: Check available RAM and reduce wordlist sizes
- **Network timeouts**: Check network connectivity and target availability

## üéØ Example Scenarios

### Small Network Assessment
```bash
# Quick scan of small network
./rdp-brute -i small_network.txt -u common_users.txt -p top_passwords.txt -o results.txt -t 10
```

### Large-Scale Assessment  
```bash
# High-speed scan with maximum threads
./rdp-brute -i enterprise_ips.txt -u domain_users.txt -p password_list.txt -o enterprise_results.txt -t 100 -v
```

### Custom Port Scanning
```bash
# Non-standard RDP port
./rdp-brute -i targets.txt -u users.txt -p passwords.txt -o results.txt -P 3390
```
