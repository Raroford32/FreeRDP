## ÔøΩ Installation & Build

### Quick Build
```bash
# Build with maximum optimizations
make -f Makefile_ultra all

# Create sample input files
make -f Makefile_ultra samples
```

### System Performance Tuning (Optional)
```bash
# Apply system-level optimizations for maximum speed
make -f Makefile_ultra tune-system
```

This will configure:
- TCP connection parameters for high-rate connections
- Increased file descriptor limits
- Optimized kernel network settings

## üìã Usage

### Required Files
- **ips.txt**: Target IP addresses (one per line)
- **users.txt**: Usernames to test (one per line) 
- **passwords.txt**: Passwords to test (one per line)

### Basic Usage
```bash
# Standard fast mode (recommended)
./rdp-ultra -i ips.txt -u users.txt -p passwords.txt -o results.txt -f

# Aggressive mode (maximum speed)
./rdp-ultra -i ips.txt -u users.txt -p passwords.txt -o results.txt -a

# Custom thread count
./rdp-ultra -i ips.txt -u users.txt -p passwords.txt -o results.txt -t 300

# Verbose mode (shows failed attempts)
./rdp-ultra -i ips.txt -u users.txt -p passwords.txt -o results.txt -v

# Custom RDP port
./rdp-ultra -i ips.txt -u users.txt -p passwords.txt -o results.txt -P 3390
```

### Command Line Options
```
Required:
  -i <file>     IP addresses file (one per line)
  -u <file>     Usernames file (one per line)
  -p <file>     Passwords file (one per line)
  -o <file>     Output results file

Optional:
  -t <num>      Number of threads (default: 100, max: 500)
  -P <port>     RDP port (default: 3389)
  -f            Fast mode (minimal output for max speed)
  -a            Aggressive mode (500 threads, optimized timeouts)
  -v            Verbose output (show failed attempts)
  -h            Show help
```

## üéØ Performance Optimization

### For Maximum Speed
1. **Use Fast Mode**: `-f` flag reduces output overhead
2. **Aggressive Mode**: `-a` uses 500 threads with optimized settings
3. **System Tuning**: Run `make tune-system` before testing
4. **Thread Count**: Set to 2-4x your CPU core count
5. **Target Selection**: Focus on responsive targets

### Example High-Performance Configuration
```bash
# Ultimate speed configuration
./rdp-ultra -i targets.txt -u users.txt -p passwords.txt -o results.txt -f -t 400

# For testing large networks
./rdp-ultra -i large_network.txt -u common_users.txt -p top_passwords.txt -o scan_results.txt -a
```

## üìà Benchmarking

### Run Performance Tests
```bash
# Quick benchmark with sample data
make -f Makefile_ultra benchmark

# Speed test with 50 threads
make -f Makefile_ultra test-speed

# Aggressive mode test
make -f Makefile_ultra test-aggressive
```

- **Network Impact**: High-speed scanning can impact network performance
- **Detection**: Rapid connection attempts are easily detected by security systems
- **Legal Compliance**: Ensure compliance with local laws and regulations

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Performance Issues
```bash
# Check system limits
ulimit -n

# Monitor network connections
ss -tuln | grep :3389

# Check system load
htop
```

### Common Issues
1. **Low Speed**: Increase thread count with `-t` option
2. **Connection Errors**: Check network connectivity and firewall rules
3. **Resource Limits**: Run `make tune-system` to optimize system settings
4. **Memory Issues**: Reduce thread count if experiencing memory pressure
